Pecan Pie Ingredients
If you have pecans and a few kitchen staples, you likely have everything you need to make this pecan pie. Here's what you'll need:

Sugar
This recipe calls for nearly two cups of granulated sugar. Some reviewers say they like to use a mixture of white and brown sugars.

Corn Syrup
Dark corn syrup adds texture, volume, and deep flavor. For a lighter flavor, use light corn syrup.

Butter
Butter gives this pie richness and a delicious depth of flavor.

Cornstarch and Water
Two teaspoons of cornstarch and a tablespoon of cold water work together to help thicken the filling.

Eggs
Whole eggs help bind the filling together and add welcome moisture.

Salt
A pinch of salt goes a long way to enhance the other flavors in the filling.

Vanilla
Vanilla extract amps up the flavor in a sweet, crowd-pleasing way. You definitely don't want to skip this ingredient.

Pecans
What would pecan pie be without pecans? Halved or chopped pecans will work well for this recipe.

Pie Shell
Use our top-rated Butter Flaky Pie Crust for guaranteed delicious results. Of course, a frozen or refrigerated crust will work in a pinch.
